## Description
The Flashcard Generator is a command-line app that allows a user to create two different kinds of flashcards to use in a quiz.  Those flashcards can then be used as quiz questions for other users in applications such as the classroom, general trivia games, etc.  The two different kinds of flashcards are:
1.  BASIC - This is your standard flashcard, consisting of a question on the front and the corresponding answer on the back.  
2.  CLOZE - This type of card makes a portion of the question visible.  For example, the front of the card might say "The first President of the United States was ...", and then say "George Washington" when the user requests it.
